# Learn-persistent-homology
This repository was created to help my students learn applied topology.

- The file My_persistent_test contains examples of persistent homology calculations. Computations are based on the package Dyonisus2 https://mrzv.org/software/dionysus2/
- The code is the complementary material for my textbook on homology (in Russian) available in the repository.
- The interactive demonstration of persistent homology can be found in https://play.unity.com/mg/other/builds-4z-1 
- I used algorithms from the textbook when I wrote that game.
